# Playbook: Vulnerability Exploitation

**ID**: PB-18
**Severity**: High/Critical
**Trigger**: IPS Alert ("Exploit Attempt"), WAF Log ("CVE-XXXX detected").

## 1. Analysis (Triage)

```mermaid
graph TD
    Alert[Exploit Alert] --> Verify{Vulnerable?}
    Verify -->|Patched| False[False Positive]
    Verify -->|Vulnerable| Response{Server Response?}
    Response -->|200 OK/Shell| Succ[Success]
    Response -->|403/Drop| Fail[Attempt Blocked]
    Succ --> Isolate[Isolate Host]
    Fail --> BlockIP[Block Attacker]
```

-   **Confirm CVE**: Which vulnerability is being targeted? (e.g., Log4Shell, BlueKeep).
-   **Check Asset**: Is the destination Vulnerable? (Check CMDB/Vuln Scan results).
-   **Response**: Did the server respond heavily? (Reverse Shell connection?).

## 2. Containment
-   **Block IP**: Block the attacker's IP.
-   **Isolate Asset**: If exploitation was successful, isolate the server.
-   **Virtual Patch**: Apply WAF/IPS signature to block the exploit payload.

## 3. Eradication
-   **Patch**: Apply the official security patch from the vendor.
-   **Configuration**: Disable the vulnerable service/port if patching is not possible immediately.

## 4. Recovery
-   **Verify Patch**: Run a vulnerability scan to confirm the hole is closed.
-   **Attribute**: [Integrity]
