## 1. Analysis

### 1.1 Compromise Type Identification

| Type | Indicators | Detection |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Spyware/Stalkerware** | Rogue MDM profiles, unknown device admin apps, battery drain | MDM, MTD |
| **Jailbreak/Root** | Cydia, Magisk, SuperSU, integrity check failures | MDM jailbreak detection |
| **Malicious App** | Sideloaded APK/IPA, unknown app with permissions | MTD, MDM app inventory |
| **SIM Swap** | Loss of cellular signal, MFA codes not received | User report, carrier |
| **Smishing/Phishing** | Suspicious SMS link clicked, credential entered | User report, MTD |
| **Network attack** | Rogue Wi-Fi, man-in-the-middle on public network | MTD, certificate errors |

### 1.2 Investigation Checklist

| Check | How | Done |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| MDM compliance status | Intune / Jamf / WS1 | ☐ |
| App inventory — any sideloaded or unknown apps? | MDM | ☐ |
| Configuration profiles — any rogue profiles? | MDM | ☐ |
| Network connections — suspicious IPs? | MTD / Network logs | ☐ |
| Corporate email access from device | Exchange / M365 logs | ☐ |
| VPN connections from device | VPN logs | ☐ |
| Cloud storage access from device | CASB / Cloud audit | ☐ |
| Was OS up to date? | MDM | ☐ |

### 1.3 Data Exposure Assessment

| Data Type | Accessible from Device? | Exposed? |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Corporate email & attachments | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ |
| Calendar & contacts | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ |
| Cloud storage (OneDrive/GDrive) | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ |
| VPN access to internal network | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ |
| Authenticator/MFA tokens | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ |
| Messaging (Teams/Slack) | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ |
| Banking/Financial apps | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ |

## 2. Containment

### 2.1 Immediate Actions

| # | Action | Tool | Done |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|
| 1 | **Remote lock** the device | MDM | ☐ |
| 2 | **Selective wipe** corporate data (App Protection) | MDM (Intune) | ☐ |
| 3 | **Remove device** from Conditional Access / compliance | IdP | ☐ |
| 4 | **Block network access** (Wi-Fi, VPN) | Wi-Fi controller / VPN | ☐ |
| 5 | **Reset user password** | AD / IdP | ☐ |
| 6 | **Revoke OAuth tokens** from the device | IdP | ☐ |

### 2.2 SIM Swap Specific

| # | Action | Done |
|:---:|:---|:---:|
| 1 | Contact carrier immediately to restore number and lock SIM | ☐ |
| 2 | Change MFA from SMS to authenticator app / FIDO2 | ☐ |
| 3 | Reset passwords for ALL accounts using SMS MFA | ☐ |
| 4 | Check for unauthorized access during SIM swap window | ☐ |
| 5 | File report with carrier and law enforcement | ☐ |

---

## 3. Eradication

| # | Action | Done |
|:---:|:---|:---:|
| 1 | **Factory reset** the device (if spyware/rootkit confirmed) | ☐ |
| 2 | Remove rogue profiles and device admin apps | ☐ |
| 3 | Uninstall malicious applications | ☐ |
| 4 | Update OS to the latest version | ☐ |
| 5 | Re-enroll device in MDM with security policies | ☐ |

---

## 4. Recovery

| # | Action | Done |
|:---:|:---|:---:|
| 1 | Restore user data from known-clean backup (**not apps**) | ☐ |
| 2 | Re-register MFA from clean device | ☐ |
| 3 | Re-enroll corporate apps (email, VPN, cloud) | ☐ |
| 4 | Enforce MDM policies: app allowlisting, block sideloading, OS updates | ☐ |
| 5 | Enable MTD (Mobile Threat Defense) if not already deployed | ☐ |
| 6 | Monitor device for 30 days | ☐ |

---

## 5. IoC Collection

| Type | Value | Source |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Malicious app name / package | | MDM / MTD |
| Rogue MDM profile | | MDM |
| Suspicious IP connections | | MTD / Network |
| Compromised accounts accessed | | SIEM / IdP |
| SIM swap timeline | | Carrier records |

---

## 6. Escalation Criteria

| Condition | Escalate To |
|:---|:---|
| Executive device compromised | CISO immediately |
| SIM swap targeting admin / VIP | CISO + Identity team |
| Corporate data exfiltrated from device | Legal + DPO (PDPA 72h) |
| Spyware with remote access capability | Tier 2 + External forensics |
| Multiple devices compromised (campaign) | Major Incident |
| Jailbroken device accessed sensitive systems | SOC Lead + IT |

---

## 7. Post-Incident

- [ ] Review MDM enrollment compliance across organization
- [ ] Update mobile security policy (jailbreak/root detection)
- [ ] Enforce OS version minimum requirements via MDM
- [ ] Review app sideloading / third-party app store policies
- [ ] Implement mobile threat defense (MTD) solution
- [ ] Conduct awareness training on mobile security best practices
- [ ] Review VPN requirements for mobile corporate access
- [ ] Document findings in [Incident Report](../../templates/incident_report.en.md)
